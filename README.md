HTML + CSS + JS MineSweeper
===========================

This is version of minesweeper game (from Windows) for browsers. Logic of game is implemented on JS, 'GUI' is written on HTML + CSS for:

* Opera
* Firefox
* Chrome
* IE6

Project is my attempt to learn JS more and apply it to practice. Another project which brings MineSweeper to Java + JS is coming soon.
